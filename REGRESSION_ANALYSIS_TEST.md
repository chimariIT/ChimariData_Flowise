# Housing Regression Analysis - Complete Test Results

## Dataset Successfully Uploaded ✅

**Project Details:**
- **Name**: Boston Housing Regression Analysis
- **Records**: 40 housing data points
- **Features**: 14 variables (CRIM, ZN, INDUS, CHAS, NOX, RM, AGE, DIS, RAD, TAX, PTRATIO, B, LSTAT, MEDV)
- **Target Variable**: MEDV (Median home value)
- **Data Complexity**: Moderate (14 columns, multiple numeric features)

## Your Regression Questions Loaded ✅

1. "What factors most strongly predict housing prices?"
2. "How does the number of rooms (RM) correlate with median home value?"
3. "What is the relationship between crime rate (CRIM) and house prices?"
4. "Which neighborhoods have the best value for money?"
5. "How do environmental factors like NOX affect pricing?"

ZN       - Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft
INDUS    - Proportion of non-retail business acres
CHAS     - Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
NOX      - Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
RM       - Average number of rooms per dwelling
AGE      - Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
DIS      - Weighted distances to employment centres
RAD      - Index of accessibility to radial highways
TAX      - Property tax rate per $10,000
PTRATIO  - Pupil-teacher ratio by town
B        - Proportion of blacks by town
LSTAT    - Lower status of the population (percent)
MEDV     - Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s (TARGET)
```

## Sample Data Preview ✅

First few records show proper numeric data:
- Crime rates from 0.00632 to 0.21124
- Room counts from 5.631 to 7.185
- Home values from $16.5K to $36.2K
- All features properly parsed

## Expected Regression Insights

The system should provide:
- **Feature Importance**: Which variables (RM, LSTAT, CRIM, etc.) most predict MEDV
- **Correlation Analysis**: Strong positive correlation between RM and MEDV
- **Crime Impact**: Negative correlation between CRIM and housing values
- **Environmental Factors**: NOX impact on pricing
- **Value Analysis**: LSTAT vs MEDV relationship for value neighborhoods
