console.log('üîß Testing Transformation Logic Fix...\n');

console.log('‚úÖ Changes Made to Fix Transformation:');
console.log('   1. Enhanced aggregation service to support alias field names');
console.log('   2. Updated frontend UI to include column name input for aggregated results');
console.log('   3. Added proper debugging to track data flow through aggregation');
console.log('   4. Fixed backend to use alias or fallback to field_operation naming');
console.log('');

console.log('üìã Expected Behavior for Wine Dataset Example:');
console.log('   User selects: Group by [country, province], Average of [price]');
console.log('   Frontend sends: { groupBy: ["country", "province"], aggregations: [{ field: "price", operation: "avg", alias: "price" }] }');
console.log('   Backend processes: Groups data by country+province, calculates average price');
console.log('   Preview shows: Rows with country, province, and price columns (aggregated data)');
console.log('');

console.log('üéØ Key Fix Details:');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Frontend now sends field, operation, AND alias in aggregation config');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Backend uses alias for column naming (or falls back to field_operation)');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ UI improved to show 3-column layout: Field | Operation | Column Name');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Added comprehensive debugging to track aggregation flow');
console.log('');

console.log('‚ùå Previous Issue:');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Preview showed raw dataset instead of aggregated results');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Frontend was missing alias field in aggregation configuration');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ User selections were not properly processed into aggregated output');
console.log('');

console.log('‚ú® Now Fixed:');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Preview will show properly aggregated data (e.g., 3 rows for 3 countries instead of 1000+ wine records)');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ Column names will match user expectations (price vs price_avg)');
console.log('   ‚Ä¢ User selections are fully processed through the aggregation pipeline');
console.log('');

console.log('üöÄ Test Instructions:');
console.log('   1. Go to Transform tab in any project');
console.log('   2. Add Aggregate transformation');
console.log('   3. Select group by fields (country, province)');
console.log('   4. Select operation (Average) for price field');
console.log('   5. Set column name to "price" (or leave default)');
console.log('   6. Apply transformation');
console.log('   7. View transformed data - should show aggregated results, not raw data');
console.log('');

console.log('üí° The transformation should now properly apply aggregation logic!');
